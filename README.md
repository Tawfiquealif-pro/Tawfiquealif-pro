 I'm Tawfique Alif, an indie developer based in Bangladesh
 I code my ideas for fun. I can design frontend along with backend.

 My main tech stack is Js, reactjs, node.js, express.js . I use figma and adobe illustrator to design front end

 I've got a lot of pin projects but my favourite is [BAFSK-ITC]("https://tawfiquealif-pro.github.io/BAFSK-ITC/") it is the recent webpage that i created for my college's IT club. Although I have over 20 unique projects in private but publicly I displayed 5-10 unique and useful 

 ## Fun fact  
 - I like anime
 - Some of my design's are inspired
 - Like cofee over tea
 - Recently watched Demon Slayer anime
